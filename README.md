# Global Supply Chain Strategy Development and Execution

## Overview
This project repository contains the strategies and implementation details of a robust global supply chain management system designed to enhance bottom-line performance by 15%. Our approach leverages innovative data analysis techniques and cross-functional collaboration to streamline operations.

## Objectives
- Optimize global supply chain processes through strategic analysis and data-driven solutions.
- Achieve real-time visibility into supply chain operations with Tableau dashboards.
- Automate processes using Python scripts to decrease lead times and boost on-time deliveries.
- Facilitate a 30% cost reduction through effective data mining and value creation.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SAP**: Utilized for comprehensive supply chain management and data analysis.
- **Advanced Excel**: Employed for data manipulation and financial modeling.
- **Tableau**: Created interactive dashboards for real-time supply chain visibility.
- **SQL**: Leveraged for data mining and extracting actionable insights.
- **Python**: Scripted automation solutions to improve supply chain efficiency.

## Outcomes
- 15% improvement in bottom-line performance attributable to optimized supply chain strategies.
- Reduction of lead times by 20% and a 10% increase in on-time deliveries, enhancing customer satisfaction.
- Cross-functional team leadership that harnessed SQL and Tableau to realize a 30% cost reduction opportunity.
